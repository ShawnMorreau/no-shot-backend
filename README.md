# no-shot-backend

No Shot is a spin off of the card game "Red Flags" in which multiple people place down cards that create "the perfect date" and another player attempts to sabotage it with a "Red Flag". 

This was my first project created in golang and I was able to thoroughly learn/refresh my knowledge of structs, pointers, reading from JSON files, and websockets. 

This version is the base version that only allows players to join a single lobby, then play. Which was good enough for the time being. Given that this was a first run through, the code is a little rough and semi non-testable which is why I created https://github.com/ShawnMorreau/noshotv2-backend
